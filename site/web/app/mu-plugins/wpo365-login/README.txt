== Upgrade Notice ==

* Please check the online version of the [release notes for version 11.0](https://www.wpo365.com/release-notes-v11-0/).

== Changelog ==

= v21.5 =
* Fix: The recently added *ID token verification* did not take the mail-authorization flow into account. [LOGIN]
* Improvement: Administrators can now re-configure the WPO365 | LOGIN plugin to skip the *ID token verification* altogether, on the plugin's *Miscellaneous* configuration page (but this is not recommended for production environments). [LOGIN]

= v21.4 =
* Fix: The built-in update checker for premium extensions might incorrectly indicate that an update for some extensions would be available. [LOGIN]

= v21.3 =
* Fix: The plugin would cause a fatal crash when using PHP 7.2 or lower. [ALL]

= v21.2 =
* Change: The WPO365 | LOGIN plugin will now verify the tenant that issued the ID token and the audience for which the ID token was issued. [LOGIN]
* Fix: Various issues with the built-in license and update checker for premium extensions and bundles.
* Fix: The Employee Directory app now will only take the host portion of the SharePoint home URL when dynamically constructing the permissions scope. [M365 APPS, INTRANET]
* Fix: The User Sync test case will skip the check for custom domains when Azure AD B2C has been selected. [SYNC, INTRANET]

= v21.1 =
* Fix: License check for premium extensions and bundles would show "unknown error occurred" for valid licenses.
* Fix: Update check for premium extensions and bundles now better aligned with the recently updated license management service.

= v21.0 =
* Improvement: Various aspects of user synchronization have been improved / refactored in an attempt to make it easier to configure, track and start / stop jobs. [SYNC, INTRANET]
* Improvement: The WPO365 plugin will now - by default - first try to look up an existing WordPress user by its Azure AD Object ID. This value uniquely identifies a user in Azure AD and is automatically configured when WPO365 creates a new user (or updates an existing one). [ALL]
* Improvement: To support Azure AD B2C user synchronization, newly created user synchronization jobs will now - by default - skip the domain check (whereby the login domain of the username of users retrieved from Microsoft Graph is matched against a list of supported custom domains on the plugin's *User registration* configuration page). Existing user synchronization jobs must be updated manually. [SYNC, INTRANET]
* Improvement: If WPO365 User synchronization has been configured, the default WordPress User list will be enhanced automatically. A column is added to show the date and time a user was last updated by WPO365 User synchronization. A second column will show a button that allows administrators to reactivate a user in case that user has been de-activated / soft-deleted by WPO365 User synchronization. [SYNC, INTRANET]

* Improvement: It is now possible to configure an embedded login experience for Azure AD B2C. See [online documentation](https://docs.wpo365.com/article/170-azure-ad-b2c-embedded-login) for details. [LOGIN+, SYNC, INTRANET]
* Fix: The *Source for custom user fields* (ID token, Microsoft Graph or SAML response) selector was not always visible on the plugin's *User sync* configuration page. [LOGIN+, CUSTOMER USER FIELDS, SYNC, INTRANET]
* Fix: The *Allow forms to override "From" address* was only enabled for application-level *Mail.Send* permissions. [MAIL, SYNC, INTRANET]
* Fix: Overriding the "From" address was sometimes ignored. [MAIL, SYNC, INTRANET]
* Fix: Sending from a Shared Mailbox was sometimes ignored. [MAIL, SYNC, INTRANET]

= v20.3 =
* Feature: Websites that are using the [Mail Integration for Office 365/Outlook](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mail-integration-365/) are now urged to switch to [WPO365 | MICROSOFT GRAPH MAILER](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpo365-msgraphmailer/) or configure the builtin Microsoft Graph mail function of the WPO365 | LOGIN plugin.

* Improvement: Administrators can check an option to **Use alternative CDN** (on the plugin's Integration page). If checked, the plugin will download the react-js and react-dom.js packages from the CloudFlare CDN (instead of from the default UNPKG CND). However, administrators can also choose to self-host these dependencies. In this case they can override the CDN configuration using a constant that must defined in wp-config.php. See the [online documentation](https://docs.wpo365.com/article/163-use-alternative-cdn-for-javascript-libraries) for details. [ALL]
* Fix: The avatar method updated in v20.0 now also overrides the get_avatar hook to avoid conflicts with other plugins such as Ultimate Member. [AVATAR, SYNC, INTRANET]

= v20.2 =
* Improvement: Administrators can now define a constant in wp-config.php to override the default CDN used to download the react.js and react-dom.js packages. This constant must be defined immediately after the line "/* That's all, stop editing! Happy publishing. */" as an array as follows: define('WPO_CDN', array('react' => 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/16.14.0/umd/react.production.min.js', 'react_dom' => 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react-dom/16.14.0/umd/react-dom.production.min.js'));

= v20.1 =

* Feature: The (premium version of the) Microsoft Graph Mailer can now send attachments larger than 3 MB. [MAIL, SYNC, INTRANET]
* Feature: The (premium version of the) Microsoft Graph Mailer can now send emails from a Shared Mailbox. [MAIL, SYNC, INTRANET]

* Improvement: Administrators can now define the name of the WordPress user meta for user attributes synchronized from Azure AD to WordPress. [LOGIN+, CUSTOM USER FIELDS, SYNC, INTRANET]

* Improvement: Now supports reading custom claims in a SAML response and save them as WordPress user meta. [LOGIN+, CUSTOM USER FIELDS, SYNC, INTRANET]
* Improvement: Administrators can now choose to skip updating a user WordPress user's displayname. [LOGIN+, USER FIELDS, SYNC, INTRANET]
* Improvement: Some parts of the source code have been updated to improve compatibility with PHP 8.1. [ALL]

* Fix: Custom formatting of a WordPress user's displayname now works as expected for SAML 2.0 based Single Sign-on. [LOGIN+, CUSTOM USER FIELDS SYNC, INTRANET]
* Fix: The shortcode properties of a Micrsoft 365 App are now HTML-decoded to handle the case where WordPress updates shortcode properties when an author edits a page. [ALL]
* Fix: The div that encapsulates a Microsoft 365 App can now be referenced by its unique classname "wpo365-app-root". [ALL]
* Fix: Some WPO365 options have been removed / renamed to avoid triggering ModSecurity OWASP CRS causing an 418 "I am not a teapot" HTTP errors, for example when hosting a site at DreamHost. [ALL]
* Fix: The plugin now correctly tries again to get a user's (Azure AD) group memberships with Group.Read.All permissions when the administrator has not (yet) granted permissions to do so using GroupMember.Read.All permissions. [ROLES + ACCESS, SYNC, INTRANET]

= v19.4 =
* Fix: Mail authorization for delegated access would fail with the error "Could not retrieve a tenant and application specific JSON Web Key Set and thus the JWT token cannot be verified successfully". [LOGIN, MICROSOFT GRAPH MAILER]
* Fix: Embedded PowerBI reports will now try to refresh the acquired access token when the browser tab is left open. [LOGIN, INTRANET, M365 APPS]
* Fix: Encoding of parameters for embedded SharePoint Online apps (Search and Documents) have been improved. [LOGIN, INTRANET, M365 APPS]
* Fix: The Audiences custom meta box has been updated and produces valid HTML. [ROLES + ACCESS, SYNC, INTRANET]

= v19.3 =
* Fix: The delegated mail authorization feature would - under circumstances - fail to get the mail specific tenant ID and as a result an attempt to refresh the access token may fail. [LOGIN, MICROSOFT GRAPH MAILER]

= v19.2 =
* Fix: The Redirect URL field for the mail authorization is no longer greyed out and can be changed by administrators. [LOGIN]

= v19.1 =
* Fix: A backward-compatibility issue with Audiences would cause a critical error when editing a page. Administrators with any of the following extensions installed must update as soon as possible: ROLES + ACCESS, SYNC, INTRANET.

= v19.0 =
* Change: Sending WordPress emails using Microsoft Graph can now also be configured with **delegated** permissions. Administrators are urged to review the [documentation](https://docs.wpo365.com/article/108-sending-wordpress-emails-using-microsoft-graph) and to update their configuration. [LOGIN, MICROSOFT GRAPH MAILER]
* Feature: **Audiences** - used to target posts and pages to specific Azure AD groups - can now also be used on a post or page using a custom metabox in the sidebar. Consult the [updated documentation](https://docs.wpo365.com/article/139-audiences) for details. [ROLES + ACCESS, SYNC, INTRANET]
* Feature: Azure Active Directory secrets can now be stored in the website's **WP-Config.php** and removed from the database. [MAIL]
* Improvement: A number of **plugin self-tests** have been improved to help administrators find loopholes in the configuration e.g. of User synchronization and the integration of various SharePoint Online services. [LOGIN]
* Fix: The plugin no longer "hijacks" a state parameter when sent in the header of any request. This prevented - amongst other things - enabling / disabling of WordPress auto-updates. [LOGIN]
* Fix: The **Employee Directory** app now shows profile information when users are searched for using SharePoint. [M365 APPS, INTRANET]
* Fix: Version bump for all WPO365 plugins.

= v18.2 =
* Fix: Recent changes to the built-in notification service could cause a fatal error for older PHP versions that has now been fixed. [LOGIN]

= v18.1 =
* Fix: If the plugin is configured to send WordPress emails using Microsoft Graph then it will now always replace the "from" email address if WordPress tries to sent emails from "wordpress@[sitename]". WordPress will propose this email address is no email is set by the plugin sending the email (e.g. Contact Form 7). This email may pass checks as a valid email address but in reality this email address most likely does not exist. The option to fix the "localhost" issue has been removed since this fix improves the behavior for all hosts (incl. localhost). [ALL]
* Improvement: Various wp-admin banners as well as some translations have been updated. Also a teaching bubble is shown on the Single Sign-on page to help admins quickly find the WPO365 documentation center at [https://docs.wpo365.com/](https://docs.wpo365.com/). [ALL]

* Change: Support for **Azure AD B2C** custom policies (sign-up, sign-in and password reset) is no longer a premium feature. [LOGIN]
* Change: All features of **WPO365 | CUSTOM USER FIELDS** extension are from now on supported by the **WPO365 | LOGIN+ extension**. See [our website](https://www.wpo365.com/downloads/wordpress-office-365-login-professional/) for details and pricing. [CUSTOM USER FIELDS, LOGIN+]
